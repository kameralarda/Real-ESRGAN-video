# Real-ESRGAN-video
Upscale videos instead of just images with a simple python code!<br>
FFmpeg required<br><br>

Edit the python code to make detailed changes to the commands, it's very simple.<br>
video-best.py does not update the real-esrgan commands, it makes it use the HEVC 265 library when creating video from frames and sets the color setting to 10 bit. This is the only difference.
